PyElly is a rule-based natural language processing tool written in
object-oriented Python. It is currently in alpha testing, but should be
available in a beta release with a basic commandline interface at the end
of 2013. At present, there are 58 Python source modules comprising about
13 thousand lines of code. Included also are various separate definition
files to support English-language capabilities. Additional modules and
resources along with example applications will be posted as they are tested
and integrated.
