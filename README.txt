PyElly is a rule-based natural language processing tool written mostly in
object-oriented Python. It has completed alpha testing and will be
available in a beta release with a basic commandline interface at the end
of 2013. At present, there are 57 Python source modules comprising about
15 thousand lines of code. Included also are various separate definition
files to support basic English-language capabilities and various examples
of rule files defining simple applications for integration testing. Other
modules and resources along with example applications will be posted as
they are tested and integrated.
